# AngularMenu

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.5.

This is an example of a basic hand-rolled responsive menu that doesn't rely on Bootstrap. Initially only a single browser breakpoint is provided to provide a mobile view.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
